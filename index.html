        <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I have been in education sales and consultation for over 7 years, identifying training requirements and advising on suitable programs that suit individual and organisation training needs.
 
My experience varies from helping graduate high school students progress towards Undergraduate study in the Creative Industry to working professionals who require soft skills in support of their roles and organizational training needs.
 
Passionate about being a problem solver and collaborating with others to obtain the best outcome for myself and my team members. My approach to sales consultation is to discover the needs, be empathetic to their situation and provide an impactful solution.
